# Proof of Work (PoW) Algorithm

## An implementation in Golang

The Proof of Work consensus algorithm involves solving a computational challenging puzzle in order to create new blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. Colloquially, the process is known as ‘mining’, and the nodes in the network that engage in mining are known as ‘miners’. The incentive for mining transactions lies in economic payoffs, where competing miners are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins(at the time of writing this article; this reward will get reduced by half its current value with time) and a small transaction fee.
